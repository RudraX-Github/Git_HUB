## 🔥 KEY INSIGHT: TEMPERATURE CORRELATION

From Phase 1, we discovered:
**Temperature Minimum = +0.81 correlation with prices**

This notebook:
1. Creates multiple temperature lag features (1-day, 3-day, 7-day)
2. Creates temperature rolling averages
3. Ensures this critical feature is properly engineered
4. Verifies it appears in top correlations in Step 13

**Expected**: Temperature lags should be top 5 features in correlation analysis

---

## 📊 FEATURE ENGINEERING BREAKDOWN

| Category | Count | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Lagged Prices** | 8 | Time-series autocorrelation |
| **Rolling Stats** | 12 | Trend & volatility capture |
| **Momentum** | 4 | Price momentum indicators |
| **Calendar** | 11 | Seasonal patterns |
| **Weather** | 31 | **Temperature lags (CRITICAL)** |
| **Business** | 12 | Commodity/market interactions |
| **Categorical** | 20-25 | Market & grade effects |
| **TOTAL** | **98-115** | **Ready for ML** |

## 🎯 TOP FEATURES EXPECTED

After running, Step 13 (Correlation Analysis) should show:

**Top 10 Features by Correlation**:
1. Temperature_Min_Lag_1, 3, or 7 ← **CRITICAL**
2. Price_MA_7 or Price_MA_30 ← Moving average
3. Month_Commodity_Avg_Price ← Seasonal premium
4. Comm_Market_Avg_Price ← Market-commodity effect
5. Price_Lag_1 or Price_Lag_7 ← Autocorrelation
6. Month_Sin or Month_Cos ← Cyclical encoding
7. Rainfall_Sum_7 ← Precipitation effect
8. Season ← Seasonal indicator
9. Wind_Speed ← Weather effect
10. Cloud_Cover ← Weather effect

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Database Connection
- Notebook attempts MySQL connection
- If fails: Non-critical warning, continues with price data
- Check credentials if needed: DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME

### First 30 Rows Dropped
- Expected behavior (lag features not available for first 30 days)
- From 14,965 → 13,900 records (normal)

### Normalization
- All numeric features standardized (mean≈0, std≈1)
- Categorical features one-hot encoded
- Ready for any ML algorithm

### Scaler Saved
- `scaler.pkl` for inference on new data
- Use in Phase 3 and production

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS AFTER PHASE 2

### Immediate (After notebook completes)
- ✅ Review Feature_Correlations.csv
- ✅ Verify temperature features in top correlations
- ✅ Check final dataset shape (13,900 × 100+)

### Phase 3 Preparation (Next)
- Create PHASE_3_ML_Models.ipynb
- Load Features_Engineered.csv
- Split data (train/val/test)
- Train commodity-specific models
- Or single model with commodity encoding

### Expected Phase 3 Timeline
- 8-12 hours for complete ML development
- XGBoost/LightGBM recommended
- Separate models per commodity (better accuracy)
