## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: NaN Handling (Cell 12)
**Problem**: TypeError when computing mean of mixed data types  
**Solution**: Filter numeric columns before filling NaNs  
**Result**: ✅ Cell executed successfully

### Fix #2: Correlation Analysis (Cell 16)
**Problem**: ValueError on string columns in correlation computation  
**Solution**: Select only numeric features for correlation  
**Result**: ✅ Cell executed successfully

**Total Fixes**: 2 applied, 0 permanent errors

## ⏭️ WHAT'S NEXT: PHASE 3

### Phase 3: ML Model Development
**Status**: ⏳ Ready to start  
**Duration**: 8-12 hours (estimated)  
**Goal**: Build model with R² > 0.85

### Quick Phase 3 Outline
1. Load Features_Engineered.csv
2. Split into train (80%) and test (20%)
3. Train multiple models:
   - XGBoost (RECOMMENDED)
   - LightGBM (ALTERNATIVE)
   - Linear Regression (BASELINE)
   - Ridge/Lasso (REGULARIZED)
4. Compare performance metrics
5. Select and optimize best model
6. Generate predictions

### Expected Phase 3 Outcome
- Trained commodity price prediction model
- Performance metrics (R², MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Feature importance from the model
- Price predictions on test set
- Documentation of approach

---

## 💡 INSIGHTS FOR PHASE 3

### Insight #1: Price History Dominates
- Top 5 features are all price-related
- This makes intuitive sense (price momentum)
- **Recommendation**: Use ensemble methods to capture interactions

### Insight #2: Weather Still Important
- 31 weather features created
- Average correlation 0.41 (lower than Phase 1 finding)
- **Reason**: Normalization reduces feature variance
- **Solution**: Tree-based models capture non-linear relationships

### Insight #3: Time-Series Matters
- Data has chronological order
- **Must use**: Time-series split (no shuffling)
- **Must avoid**: Predicting past from future

### Insight #4: Commodity Variations
- 68 different commodities
- **Options**: Unified model OR commodity-specific models
- **Try first**: Unified model (simpler)
