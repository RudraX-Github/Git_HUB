Pre-Trained Model

MediaPipe Pose (Google)

✅ Already comes pre-trained, lightweight, and optimized for real-time webcam use.
✅ No need to manually download weights — it’s bundled with the mediapipe library.
✅ Outputs 33 body landmarks (x, y, z coordinates) that you can map to actions (wave, sit, jump).
✅ Easy integration with OpenCV for live feed.
⚡ Best for gesture/action recognition pipelines where you log results (CSV).
